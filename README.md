# Cancer-Prediction-model
 The dataset provided seems to be designed for predicting cancer risk based on various health and lifestyle factors.  This dataset likely aims to use the variables to predict the likelihood of cancer or assess the risk factors contributing to cancer in patients.
  Here's a detailed description of each field:

    Patient Id: A unique identifier assigned to each patient in the dataset.

    Age: The age of the patient, which is a critical factor in determining the likelihood of cancer, as risk often increases with age.

    Gender: The gender of the patient. Certain types of cancers are more common in specific genders.

    AirPollution: The level of exposure to air pollution. Chronic exposure to pollutants can increase the risk of developing cancer.

    Alcoholuse: Whether the patient consumes alcohol. Alcohol use is a known risk factor for several types of cancer.

    DustAllergy: Whether the patient has an allergy to dust. While this may not directly cause cancer, it can influence respiratory health.

    OccuPationalHazards: Exposure to hazardous substances or conditions in the patient's occupation. Occupational exposure to carcinogens can increase cancer risk.

    GeneticRisk: The presence of genetic predispositions or family history of cancer. Genetic factors can significantly impact cancer risk.

    chronicLungDisease: Whether the patient has a chronic lung disease, which can be a risk factor for lung cancer and other health issues.

    BalancedDiet: Whether the patient follows a balanced diet. Nutrition plays a role in overall health and cancer prevention.

    Obesity: Whether the patient is obese. Obesity is associated with an increased risk of several types of cancer.

    Smoking: Whether the patient smokes. Smoking is a well-known major risk factor for various cancers, particularly lung cancer.

    PassiveSmoker: Whether the patient is exposed to secondhand smoke. Passive smoking can also increase cancer risk.

    ChestPain: Whether the patient experiences chest pain, which can be a symptom of cancer or other serious conditions.

    CoughingofBlood: Whether the patient coughs up blood, which can be a symptom of lung cancer or other serious diseases.

    Fatigue: Whether the patient experiences unusual fatigue. Chronic fatigue can be a symptom of cancer or other health issues.

    WeightLoss: Whether the patient has experienced unexplained weight loss. Weight loss can be a sign of cancer.

    ShortnessofBreath: Whether the patient experiences shortness of breath, which can be a symptom of lung cancer or other respiratory conditions.

    Wheezing: Whether the patient has wheezing, which can be associated with respiratory conditions including some types of cancer.

    SwallowingDifficulty: Whether the patient has trouble swallowing, which can be a symptom of cancers affecting the throat or esophagus.

    ClubbingofFingerNails: Whether the patient has clubbing of the fingernails, which can be a sign of lung cancer or other health issues.

    FrequentCold: Whether the patient experiences frequent colds. While not directly a cancer symptom, it could indicate a weakened immune system.

    DryCough: Whether the patient has a dry cough, which can be a symptom of respiratory cancers.

    Snoring: Whether the patient snores. Snoring is generally more related to sleep disorders but can also be a symptom in some respiratory conditions.

    Level (Target): This could refer to the severity of the patient's condition or the risk level of developing cancer, depending on the specific definition used in the dataset.
